# We need to find zones within a set of parcels that contain a certain amount of stream length
import arcpy


# Import the parcels and the stream footage


# Two options:

## Option 1: find a parcel and then select equal areas around it to find the most stream LF until you find the LF you're looking for


## Option 2: use an increasing in size fishnet to find areas that fit the LF you're looking for
